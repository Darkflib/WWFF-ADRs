# Git Version Control

## Context and Problem Statement

Version control is essential for tracking changes, enabling collaboration, and maintaining code quality. How should we standardize our Git usage practices to ensure consistent workflows, reliable releases, and effective collaboration across development teams?

## Considered Options

* GitHub Flow (single main branch with feature branches)
* GitFlow (develop and main branches with feature, release, and hotfix branches)
* Trunk-based development (frequent commits to main branch)
* Custom branching strategies
* Various Git hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **GitHub as hosting platform with a modified GitFlow branching strategy**, because:

* GitHub provides an integrated platform for code hosting, issue tracking, pull requests, and CI/CD workflows
* A modified GitFlow approach with main and develop branches provides a clear separation between production code and development code
* This approach supports our need for quality control via code reviews and automated testing
* The selected approach integrates well with our CI/CD pipeline and deployment processes
* Pre-commit hooks help enforce code quality standards automatically

## Details

### Git Platform

We use GitHub as our primary Git hosting platform due to its robust feature set:

* Pull requests with review capabilities
* Issue tracking and project management
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
* Integrated security scanning
* Artifact and package hosting capabilities

### Branching Strategy

We implement a modified GitFlow branching strategy with the following branches:

1. **`main`** - Production-ready code that has been thoroughly tested and released
   * Protected branch that requires pull requests and approvals
   * Direct commits are not allowed
   * Each merge to main should be tagged with a version number
   * Represents the current production release

2. **`develop`** - Integration branch for ongoing development
   * Protected branch that requires pull requests and approvals
   * Contains all completed features intended for the next release
   * Should always be in a buildable state
   * Automated tests must pass before merging

3. **Feature branches**
   * Named using the convention `feature/<feature-name>` or `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
   * Created from and merged back into `develop`
   * Should focus on a single feature or issue
   * Deleted after merging

4. **Bugfix branches**
   * Named using the convention `bugfix/<bugfix-name>` or `bugfix/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
   * Created from and merged back into `develop` for regular bugs
   * Created from `main` and merged into both `main` and `develop` for critical production fixes
   * Deleted after merging

### Commit Standards

1. **Commit messages**
   * Follow the conventional commits specification: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
   * Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   * Keep the first line under 72 characters
   * Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   * Include issue/ticket references where applicable

2. **Commit frequency**
   * Commit early and often during development
   * Keep commits focused and atomic (one logical change per commit)
   * Rebase and squash before creating pull requests to maintain a clean history

### Code Reviews

1. Pull requests are required for all changes to protected branches
2. At least one approval is required before merging
3. Code reviews should focus on:
   * Code correctness and logic
   * Test coverage
   * Adherence to coding standards
   * Security considerations
   * Documentation

### Release Management

1. **Versioning**
   * Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   * Tag all releases in Git with the version number prefixed with 'v' (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
   * Include release notes that summarize changes

2. **Changelogs**
   * Maintain a CHANGELOG.md file in the repository root following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
   * Organize changes by version under sections: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
   * Focus on documenting what changed and why, not how (implementation details belong in commit messages)
   * Write changelogs for humans, not machines - they should be readable and understandable
   * Update the changelog as part of feature branches, not at release time
   * Link to issues/PRs where appropriate for additional context

3. **Release Process**
   * Merge `develop` into `main` for releases
   * Create a release tag with appropriate version number
   * Generate GitHub release notes that reference the changelog
   * Ensure the changelog is up to date before finalizing a release

### Automation with Git Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to automate quality checks before commits:

```yaml
# Example .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: check-added-large-files

-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 24.1.1
    hooks:
    -   id: black

-   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.13.2
    hooks:
    -   id: isort
        args: ["--profile", "black"]

-   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 7.0.0
    hooks:
    -   id: flake8

-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.8.0
    hooks:
    -   id: mypy
        additional_dependencies: [types-requests, pydantic]
```

### Large File Handling

For large binary files that don't belong in Git:
* Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for assets that need version tracking
* Store build artifacts in artifact repositories, not Git
* Use cloud storage for large datasets and reference them in code

## Consequences

### Positive

* Clear workflow for making changes and contributions
* Improved code quality through automated checks and reviews
* Reliable versioning and release management
* Better visibility into project history and changes
* Enforcement of coding standards via automation

### Negative

* More complex branching strategy compared to trunk-based development
* Additional overhead for managing branches and pull requests
* Learning curve for developers new to the workflow
* Potential for merge conflicts in long-lived feature branches

## Related Decisions

* [0025 CI/CD](./0025-ci-cd.md)
* [0026 Container Registry](./0026-container-registry.md)
* [0028 Python Linting](./0028-python-linting.md)

## Notes

While this ADR establishes our Git workflow, teams should adapt the specifics to their project needs while maintaining the core principles. The complexity of the branching strategy should be proportional to the project size, team size, and release cadence.

The GitHub repository structure should include:
* A well-maintained README.md with clear setup instructions
* A CONTRIBUTING.md file that explains the development workflow
* Issue and pull request templates to standardize submissions
* Branch protection rules to enforce the required processes
